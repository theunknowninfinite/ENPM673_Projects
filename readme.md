* Project 3 deals with Camera Calibration,using OpenCV functions and without the use of higher level functions of OpenCV.
* Project 4 deals with Stereo Vision , extracting a depth map without the use of higher level functions of OpenCV.
* Mid-term contains the code and solutions for the mid-term (Question paper is included in the Folder).
## 3. Running the Code
