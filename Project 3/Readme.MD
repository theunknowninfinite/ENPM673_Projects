The code has two parts, q1 is for the first question and q2 is for the second question.
It can be run by the following command:

python nameoffile.py
````
## Notes:

* There maybe few RuntimeWarnings and DeprecationWarning that pop up which do not affect the running of the program nor the values the program gives out.
* The source data  of  files have to placed in the same directory.
* The script may take some time to finish running.
